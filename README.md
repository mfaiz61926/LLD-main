## Overview
This repository contains **Low-Level Design (LLD)** implementations for various system design problems. The aim is to provide detailed, modular, and maintainable designs that adhere to object-oriented principles and design patterns.

---

## Design Principles
The implementations in this repository follow these design principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

Additionally, relevant **design patterns** are applied, such as:

- Singleton
- Factory
- Observer
- Strategy
- Builder

---

## UML Diagrams
All UML diagrams for each module are stored in the `diagrams/` folder. Typical diagrams included:

- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Component diagrams (where applicable)

---

## Modules
Each module is implemented as an independent project. Example modules:

1. **Parking Lot System**
   - Classes: Vehicle, ParkingSlot, ParkingLot, Payment
   - Features: Dynamic slot assignment, Payment calculation, Vehicle management.

2. **Library Management System**
   - Classes: Book, Member, Librarian, Library
   - Features: Book lending, Fine calculation, Inventory management.

3. **Online Food Ordering System**
   - Classes: Restaurant, Menu, Order, Delivery
   - Features: Order processing, Delivery tracking, Payment management.
